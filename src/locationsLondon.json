The Carlyle Mansions (number 24) there have been nicknamed the 'Writersâ€™ Block,' as it has been home to Henry James, Erskine Childers, T. S. Eliot, Somerset Maugham, Ian Fleming and other noted authors. Other authors have lived near by. George Elliot spent the last three weeks of her life at number 4. Bram Stoker lived at number 27. And Elizabeth Gaskell was born at number 93."
