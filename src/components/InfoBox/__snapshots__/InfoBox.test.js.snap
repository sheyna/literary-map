        Among the most famous literary families the Brontë sisters wrote some of the most beloved works in literature. The parsonage where they lived with their father and brother is now a museum. The family, with the exception of Anne is buried in the church's vault. The Brontë Waterfall nearby was a favorite site of the sisters.
